### Hi, I'm Gregor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Crafter and Software Development Coach.

- Sometimes I [blog](https://gregorriegler.com/blog), and I also did a [refactoring video series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsWg_i6X4KMhjD2CRqCJLdg).
- I'm employed at [ebcont](https://www.ebcont.com/) where I help people find joy in what they do, and deliver quality effectively. I also facilitate regular daylong [Coding Dojos](https://gregorriegler.com/2022/01/07/running-a-company-coding-dojo.html) there.
- I also do some opensource development. Recently mostly working on [mob.sh](https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/mob). 
- I usually join and sometimes organize Viennas Zero Overhead Coderetreats at [SwkWien](https://www.softwerkskammer.org/groups/wien).
- You can find me on Twitter [@gregor_riegler](https://twitter.com/gregor_riegler).
