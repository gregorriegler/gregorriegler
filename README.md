### Hi, I'm Gregor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Crafter and Software Development Coach.

- Currently, I'm employed at [ebcont](https://www.ebcont.com/), and in my free time I help and improve [mob.sh](https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/mob). 
- I usually join and sometimes organize Viennas Zero Overhead Coderetreats at [SwkWien](https://www.softwerkskammer.org/groups/wien).
