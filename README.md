### Hi, I'm Gregor ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Development Coach and Crafter on a lifelong journey to learn better ways to develop quality software. I like to practice with friends and teach and share what I learned. My goal is to help people find joy in their work and become better at developing software.

- Sometimes I [blog](https://gregorriegler.com/blog), and I also did a [refactoring video series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsWg_i6X4KMhjD2CRqCJLdg).
- I'm employed at [ebcont](https://www.ebcont.com/) where I facilitate regular daylong Coding Dojos as described in my latest [blog](https://gregorriegler.com/2022/01/07/running-a-company-coding-dojo.html).
- I love opensource and help improve [mob.sh](https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/mob).
